 Google Earth Engine JavaScript files as various tools

##Google Earth Engine Scripts
This is a collection of code to be used with Google Earth Engine Javascript API. 
If you are already signed up in Google Earth Engine, just copy and paste my code in the Google Earth Engine Code Editor.

Some of the scripts may depend on assets. Ideally, you would create a new set of assets specific to your project such as Areas of Interest or Boundaries.
If you would like access to the assets used to create these scripts, shoot me an email at shua.stratos@gmail.com and I can share them with you. 

Note: If you are interested in tutorials or code snippets for Google Earth Engine JavaScript API, feel free to write me an email to shua.stratos@gmail.com
